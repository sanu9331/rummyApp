            <p class="rummy-game-para">The origins of Rummy Game can be traced back to the 18th century in Mexico,
                where
                a game called Conquian was played. The game<br> eventually made its way to the USA, where it was
                modified
                and became known as Rummy. The game then travelled across the world and<br> eventually made its way
                to
                India as well, where it has become one of the most popular card games<br>
                <br>
                Rummy Game demands strategy and good cognitive skills and due to this reason it is called skill
                based game. Often played during festive<br> season and other family gatherings, rummy has now found
                its
                way to our smartphones as well. As we live in the times of 5G networks, online<br> games are
                increasingly
                becoming part of our daily life as a source of entertainment. This is also one of the main reasons
                why popularity of<br> rummy apps is soaring among all age groups in India.

            <p class="rummy-game-text">Rummy Rules</p>
            <p class="rummy-game-para">If you ever wonder how to play rummy when you are a beginner, then you need
                not
                worry. The rules of Rummy are relatively<br> simple. The game is typically played with 2 or 6
                players,
                and each player is dealt 13 cards. The objective of the game is to<br> create sets and sequences
                with
                the
                cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or more cards of the same rank, and a<br> sequence is
                a
                group of three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order.<br>
                <br> The game begins with a player drawing a card from the deck and then discarding one card from
                their
                hand. The next player can<br> either pick up the discarded card or draw a card from the deck. The
                game
                continues in this manner, with players drawing<br> and discarding cards until one player has created
                sets and sequences with all of their cards and declares the cards. <br> When a player declares, the
                cards are shown to the other players, and the other players must verify
                that the sets and sequences are valid. If the sets and sequences are valid, the player who declared
                wins the game.
